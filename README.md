Where I left off:
It looks like I need a file manager to be able to poke around my android phone. They make them with no rooting required. This may not be necessary for describing how to install and use the app.
I need to figure out how to have easy control over file locations on the phone so that I can troubleshoot and get everything set up.
It looks like GeckoDriver may work as is on the phone.... Or not. IDFK yet.

Learned about docstrings
Got to practice building Python classes


NOTES:
Have the Android notification take you to the jobs page when clicked (even when no jobs available).
HERE'S A BIG NOTE: THIS COMPARES THE OLD RESULTS TO THE NEW TO DETERMINE IF  AJOB WAS POSTED. IF THEY DELETE A JOB, IT'LL TELL ME A JOB WAS POSTED.
